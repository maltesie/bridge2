## Installation guide

This is a standalone version of Bridge2. It is written in Python3 and Qt5 and depends on Qt5
(5.14.1+) and the python packages MDAnalysis (0.19.2+) and PySide2 (5.14.1+).

To set up a virtual python environment with those packages installed, open up a terminal
and cd into the directory you want to have the environment installed in. Then install the
prerequisites:


### 1.a Ubuntu Linux dependencies

> sudo apt-get install qt5-default build-essential python3-dev python3-venv


### 1.b macOS dependencies

In order to install the required software for Bridge2 to work, we recommend using the 
Homebrew package manager. The later commands assume it is installed on your system. You can
install Homebrew by running the following command in a terminal:

> /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"

Then install the prerequisites:

> xcode-select --install

> brew install qt5 python


### 2 Setup and run Bridge2

Then run the setup script that comes with bridge:

> ./setup

This will create a python virtual environment containing all the necessary packages.
You can now run Bridge2 using the following command:

> ./bridge

### 3 Reinstall or update Bridge2

If you install a new version of Bridge2, delete your old installation folder, unpack the new archive, cd into the new bridge2 folder and follow the instructions under step 2.
