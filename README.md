## Installation Guide

This is a standalone version of Bridge. It is written in Python3 and Qt5 and depends on Qt5
(5.14.1+) and the python packages MDAnalysis (0.19.2+) and PySide2 (5.14.1+).


### Ubuntu Linux

To set up a virtual python environment with those packages installed, open up a terminal
and cd into the directory you want to have the environment installed in. Then install the
prerequisites:

> sudo apt-get install qt5-default build-essential python3-dev python3-venv

Then run the setup script that comes with bridge:

> ./setup

This will create a python virtual environment containing all the necessary packages.
You can now run bridge using the following command:

> ./bridge

If you install a new version of Bridge, delete your old installation folder, unpack the new
archive and run ./setup once again to set the new version up. After that start Bridge with 
./bridge

### macOS

In order to install the required software for Bridge2 to work, we recommend using the 
Homebrew package manager. The later commands assume it is installed on your system. You can
install Homebrew by running the following command in a terminal:

> /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"

To set up a virtual python environment with the necessary packages installed, cd into the directory 
you want to have the environment installed in. Then install the prerequisites:

'''
xcode-select --install
brew install qt5 python
'''

Then run the setup script that comes with bridge:

> ./setup

This will create a python virtual environment containing all the necessary packages.
You can now run bridge using the following command:

> ./bridge

If you install a new version of Bridge, delete your old installation folder, unpack the new
archive and run ./setup once again to set the new version up. After that start Bridge with 
./bridge
